# Voxa App Setup

## Supabase Email Authentication

Voxa uses Supabase Auth. Email/password is the active sign-in path for local product testing.

Create `voxa-beta/.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

In Supabase:

1. Open Authentication -> Providers.
2. Enable Email.
3. Enable email confirmations so new users verify their email before logging in.
4. Add these redirect URLs in Authentication -> URL Configuration -> Redirect URLs:
   - `http://localhost:3000/login?verified=true`
   - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
   - your deployed app login URL, for example `https://beta.usevoxa.vercel.app/login?verified=true`

Google sign-in remains visible in the UI, but it is intentionally not the active test path yet.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Current Product Scope

The app supports:

- email/password sign up, login, persisted session, and logout
- email verification and verification email resend
- protected app routes
- start room and join room flow
- shareable room links
- browser-session room state
- Nova invite state
- participant and room event display

The voice pipeline is intentionally outside the current scope.
